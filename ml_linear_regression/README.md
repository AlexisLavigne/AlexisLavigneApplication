# ML Linear Regression
A new world organization has just been created. It includes all the museum management committees that have more than 2,000,000 visitors annually (in 2018). 
This list is available via Wikipedia: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_most_visited_museums

This new organization wishes to correlate the tourist attendance at their museums with the population of the respective cities. To achieve this you must:
- Retrieve and store programmatically this list of museums (name, city, visits) 
- Programmatically join the population to the museum list. You can use this dataset https://www.kaggle.com/max-mind/world-cities-database . 

In addition, you are asked to create a small linear regression ML algorithm to correlate the city population and the influx of visitors. Finally plot the result of the regression.

The assignment must be done in Python, you should include any visualisation that you find helpful.
